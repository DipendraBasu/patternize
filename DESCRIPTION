Description: Provides functions for quantifying variation in color
    patterns as obtained from image data. Patternize defines homology between
    pattern positions across images either through fixed landmarks or image
    registration. Pattern identification is performed by categorizing the
    distribution of colors using either an RGB threshold or unsupervised image
    segmentation.
