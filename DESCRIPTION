Description: patternize is an R package that quantifies variation in color
    patterns as obtained from image data. patternize defines homology between
    pattern positions across specimens either through fixed landmarks or image
    registration. Pattern identification is performed by categorizing the
    distribution of colors using either an RGB threshold or an unsupervised image
    segmentation.
